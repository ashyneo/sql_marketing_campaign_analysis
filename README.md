### 3. Top 5 Campaigns ‚Äì Highest Avg. Clicks per Conversion

_**Insight:**_ Some campaigns showed **exceptional conversion efficiency**. For example, campaign **CMP_MY63GT** recorded only 15 clicks but generated 974 conversions, equating to just 0.02 clicks per conversion. This might reflect referral or influencer effects where one click leads to many purchases.

|----------|--------------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| CMP_MY63GT      | 15         | 974          | 0.02  |
| CMP_HRX2CJ    | 17         | 738          | 0.02  |

### 4. ROI & Conversions for Discount Range 10%‚Äì14%
_**Insight:**_ Surprisingly, **discount levels do not strongly correlate with ROI or conversions**. Average ROI stays around 2.5 even at steep discounts up to 69%, and conversions hover between 400-500 across discount tiers. This suggests that deeper discounts alone don‚Äôt guarantee better campaign results and may risk profitability.


 Discount Level (%) | Average ROI | Avg. Conversions | Max ROI | Max Conversions |
|--------------------|-------------|------------------|---------|------------------|
| 10                 | 2.72        | 533.44           | 4.97    | 993              |
| 11                 | 2.76        | 471.09           | 4.98    | 995              |
| 12                 | 2.74        | 491.13           | 4.99    | 984              |
| 13                 | 2.75        | 509.10           | 4.99    | 998              |
| 14                 | 2.70        | 514.75           | 5.00    | 994              |	
| ...                 | ...        | ...              | ...     | ...              |	
| 69                 | 2.62        | 519.05           | 4.99    | 998              |

### 5. Categorized Discount Range ‚Äì Sorted by Avg. ROI & Conversions
_**Insight:**_ Discounts in the **30%-39% range provide the best balance**, yielding the highest average conversions (511) and strong ROI. While the 40%-49% range edges out slightly on ROI, it sees fewer conversions, suggesting that "too high" discounts do not always boost performance.


 discount range | average ROI     | avg_conversions | 
|----------|------------|--------------|
| 10--19%        | 2.71         | 499.04           |      
| 20--29%     | 2.74 | 507.94           |           
| 30--39%       | 2.79     | 510.99           |           
| 40--49%       | 2.80  | 489.84           |           
| 50%+      | 2.75      | 492.78           |

### 6. Top Bundle Prices vs Units Sold  
_**Insight:**_ There is **no clear pattern between bundle price and sales volume**. Prices hover around $50, but units sold vary widely, from 14 to nearly 200, implying factors like product appeal, promotion, or bundle content impact sales more than price alone.

### 7. Average Customer Satisfaction Scores by Bundle Price Range  

_**Insight:**_ Customer satisfaction scores are **stable across all price levels**, ranging narrowly from 2.47 to 2.54 out of 5. This indicates price is not a major factor in satisfaction; instead, quality, brand experience, or service likely drive how customers feel about their purchases.


 Price Range       | Average Satisfaction |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| $100 ‚Äì $199       | 2.51                 |
| $200 ‚Äì $299       | 2.47                 |
| Above $300+       | 2.50                 |
| Below $100        | 2.54                 |

## ‚ö° Immediate Insights & Recommended Actions

- üìà **PROVEN Campaign Winners:**  
  Campaigns like `CMP_2GQ60B`, `CMP_5590UQ`, and `CMP_U44WCH` consistently deliver the highest ROI. These represent repeatable winning strategies that marketing teams should study and replicate to maximize future campaign success.

- üí° **Revenue Driven by Volume, NOT Price:**  
  Surprisingly, the **Basic subscription tier generates more revenue than Premium**, likely due to a larger or more loyal customer base. This highlights an opportunity to focus on upselling and retention within the Basic tier to boost returns.

- üéØ **INVESTIGATE Ultra-Effective Campaigns:**  
  Some campaigns, such as `CMP_MY63GT`, achieve exceptional conversion rates‚Äîpossibly due to referral programs or influencer marketing. Diving deeper into these could uncover powerful tactics to scale across other campaigns.

- üí∞ **Discounts DO NOT ALWAYS MEAN Better Results:**  
  Offering bigger discounts doesn‚Äôt automatically improve ROI or conversions. Most customers are **price insensitive**, so aggressive discounting can erode profits without boosting sales. Instead, focus on **mid-range discounts (30-39%)** to balance customer attraction with profitability.

- üòä **Customer Satisfaction IS NOT About Price:**  
  Satisfaction scores remain steady across all price ranges, suggesting that **quality and brand experience matter more** than price in shaping how customers feel.

- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Emotional Appeal BEATS Affordability:**  
  While `Affordable` is the most frequently used campaign keyword, it correlates with lower conversions. This shows that **emotional and aspirational messaging drives stronger customer engagement** than price-focused language.

From these insights, we now have a clearer, actionable direction to optimize marketing strategies, pricing, and messaging for stronger business results.
